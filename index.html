        <p>I've worked with literally hundreds of HTML/CSS developers and I have to say the top spot goes to this guy. This guy is an amazing developer. He stresses on good, clean code and pays heed to the details. I love developers who respect each and
            every aspect of a throughly thought out design and do their best to put it in code. He goes over and beyond and transforms ART into PIXELS - without a glitch, every time.</p>

        <p>This guy is an amazing frontend developer that delivered the task exactly how we need it, do your self a favor and hire him, you will not be disappointed by the work delivered. He will go the extra mile to make sure that you are happy with your
            project. I will surely work again with him!</p>

        <p>This guy is a hard worker. Communication was also very good with him and he was very responsive all the time, something not easy to find in many freelancers. We'll definitely repeat with him.</p>

        <div class="progresBar"></div>
        <p>I had my concerns that due to a tight deadline this project can't be done. But this guy proved me wrong not only he delivered an outstanding work but he managed to deliver 1 day prior to the deadline. And when I asked for some revisions he made
            them in MINUTES. I'm looking forward to work with him again and I totally recommend him. Thanks again!</p>
